The NPTEL has adopted the MOOC (Massive open online course) model so that students outside IIT system can also participate in learning quality content and get certified, provided they meet the assessment criteria in the exams conducted at the end of the NPTEL semesters. All courses are free to enrol and learn from. The certification exam is optional and comes at a fee of Rs 1000 per course exam. Course credits can also be transferred to other higher education institutions student or the Academic Bank of Credits under the UGC guidelines. NPTEL courses aim for equitable access.
